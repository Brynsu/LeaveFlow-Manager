# LeaveFlow-Manager
Project By: Team Alegamers

The system is designed to allow employees to submit leave requests and enable supervisors or HR administrators to review, approve, or reject those requests. It manages different leave types such as vacation leave, sick leave, and emergency leave while tracking leave balances and request history.

This project applies core OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and service-based design to create an organized and structured system. The goal is to simulate a real-world company leave management process in a simple and efficient way.
